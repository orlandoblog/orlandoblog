## What is an inventory management system?

[Inventory management](https://medevel.com/20-warehouse-systems/) software is a [computerized system to manage](https://www.scnsoft.com/software-development/inventory-system) , track the number of stored goods. Inventory management is a major part of supply chain management.

***

***

Inventory management solutions keep track of the goods while moving through the process or stored in the warehouses. [Inventory database software](https://www.scnsoft.com/software-development/databases/inventory) helps to save all the details including serial numbers, barcodes, costs, location, the number of goods, events date for every step in the process

For example you could put the sentence here - Most of the ERP "Enterprise resource planning" systems have Inventory management as an internal package. This is one of the important stages of [ERP integration](https://jelvix.com/blog/erp-system-integration). As well as many eCommerce solutions.

Sometimes [small and medium-size businesses](https://medevel.com/top-5-free-and-open-source-inventory-management-systems-for-small-and-medium-sized-businesses/) use Excel to make it simple for managers to keep everything organized in a simple, portable, popular format. However, it can be a nightmare with a rich warehouse and dynamic supply chain or a popular eCommerce site.

Ms. Excel and other open-source spreadsheet programs can be used to manage inventory for small and medium businesses. However, it sometimes requires a spreadsheet guru to create his tools and templates.

The advantages of using Microsoft Excel and open-source spreadsheet programs or office suites (LibreOffice) are: the files will be portable, easy to understand and manage, can be used on cloud-based offices like Google spreadsheet and Microsoft cloud office services. On the downside, it'll consume hours while the dynamic supply chain process gets more complicated. So, here come inventory managers.

Microsoft Excel users have the luxury to look for a [template](https://templates.office.com/en-us/warehouse-inventory-tm02930030) that fulfills their requirements and customize it. There are many Excel templates online.

***

## Conclusion

Inventory managers as part of the supply chain process vary from one business to another, It's up to the managers and executives to select the best options that ease their work and their employees. We would recommend going for ERP-based inventory managers instead of standalone solutions if you have a full supply chain process.

If you are running a simple warehouse, and you are just wanted to manage your stock, Excel templates or standalone inventory/ stock management solutions will do the trick.

In this article, we have covered several inventory management solutions. However, we did not cover custom packages which designed to run special warehouses or stores like medication/ drugs as pharmacy managers, IT assets managers and chemical assets/ warehouse/ laboratories assets management solutions. But, we are planning to review them in separate articles.
